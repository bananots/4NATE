## üöÄ **Deployment**

To deploy this project, you‚Äôll need to deploy both the **client (frontend)** and **server (backend)** separately. Below are the general steps:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy the Client (Frontend)**

The frontend is built with Vite. You can deploy it using platforms like **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** or **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)**.

- Ensure your entire project (including the client and server folders) is pushed to a GitHub repository.
- Sign up for Vercel or Netlify.
- Connect your GitHub repository to the platform.
- During the setup, specify the `client` folder as the root directory for the frontend.
- Follow the deployment steps (usually automatic).
- Your frontend will be live at a provided URL.

**For detailed instructions, refer to the official Vite deployment guide:**

üëâ [Vite Deployment Guide](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy.html)

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy the Server (Backend)**

The backend is built with Express.js. You can deploy it using platforms like **[Render](https://render.com/)** or **[Railway](https://railway.com/)**.

- Ensure your entire project (including the client and server folders) is pushed to a GitHub repository.
- Sign up for Render or Railway.
- Connect your GitHub repository to the platform.
- During the setup, specify the `server` folder as the root directory for the backend.
- Add your environment variables (from `.env`) in the platform‚Äôs settings.
- Follow the deployment steps.
- Your backend will be live at a provided URL.

**For detailed instructions, refer to the official Express.js deployment guide:**

üëâ [Express.js Deployment Guide](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-performance.html#deployment)

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Update the API Configuration**

After deploying the backend, update the baseURL in the `config.js` file to point to your live backend URL. For example:

```js
api: {
  baseURL: "https://your-backend-url.com", // Replace with your live backend URL
  sendEmailEndpoint: "/send-email",
},
```

---

## üìú **Summary**

- Deploy the **frontend** using **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** or **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)**, and specify the `client` folder as the root directory.
- Deploy the **backend** using **[Render](https://render.com/)** or **[Railway](https://railway.com/)**, and specify the `server` folder as the root directory.
- Update the `baseURL` in `config.js` to point to your live backend.

---

## üîß **Important Notes**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Since the `frontend` and `backend` are in the same repository, you‚Äôll need to specify the correct folder **(client or server)** during deployment.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure your backend is properly deployed and running before updating the `baseURL` in the frontend configuration.
